# thumbnail generation workflow
This workflow uses PySceneDetect to identify important sections within the provided video and extracts the highest quality keyframes. It then provides examples for compelling thumbnails that come with a title, generated using GPT-4 on the video's transcript. Users can also specify which font from a selection of available fonts as well as the number of overlaid images they would like in the final thumbnail candidates, ranging from 1 to 3 (coming soon).
